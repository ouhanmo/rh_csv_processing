# Robinhood CSV Processing Program
### Han-Mo Ou
### March 2024
This program takes the CSV file Robinhood sends to its users and computes the realised gains of each transaction. Created to help me understand how a non-resident alien (like me) should file taxes in the US. I apologise if any accounting mistakes are present. I don't understand most of the stuff, anyway.   

You are free to modify according to your needs.

Please use this at your own risk. This is not legal advice. I do not take any responsibility for the users' tax returns.

## Setup
Requires Pandas package.

## To use this program

Please change the filenames in the code according to your needs. 

Please remove the spaces from the header in the CSV file Robinhood created, i.e. the first row being "ActivityDate,ProcessDate,SettleDate,Instrument,Description,TransCode,Quantity,Price,Amount". I don't think that this is necessary, but whatever.
